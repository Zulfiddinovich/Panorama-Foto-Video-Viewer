# How it works
**Virtual-reality photography** is the interactive viewing of panoramic photographs, generally encompassing a 360-degree circle or a 
spherical view. The results is known as **VR photograph** (or VR photo), **360-degree photo**, **photo sphere**, or **spherical photo**, as well as 
interactive **panorama** or immersive **panorama**.

There are 4 types of stitching photos together to see 360 panorama:
1. **Rectilinear stitching** (operator manually rotates the camera clockwise, the camera stops or clicks into a detent at regular intervals, such as every 30Â° of rotation)
2. **Spherical stitching** (This method requires the use of a "Fisheye lens" equipped digital SLR camera.)
3. **Cubical stitching** (Today, this technique is considered rather "old school," and spherical stitching has become more mainstream for producing these types of tours.)
4. **One-shot optics** (Using one-shot panoramic optics one can create quick and easy panoramic videos and images such as the type used on the iPhone.)
